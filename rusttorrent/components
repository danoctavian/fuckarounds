multi torrenting?
given that one needs to fetch multiple torrent at the same time does it reuse the same connection with that peer? probably yes, in which case one cannot have complete independece between torrent jobs. let there be a common pool of peer connections - with that in common, the rest of the stuff is independent

if has_torrent_file:
  if trackerless:
    find peer through dht
  else 
    find peer from tracker
else
